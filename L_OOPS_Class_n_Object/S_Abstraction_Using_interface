.                           Interfaces

Interfaces is a blueprint of a class

         blueprint   ---->   blueprint   ----> Obj
        (InterFaces)          (Class)

for Interfaces we use  : "implements" keyword

    Interfaces             Class
        |                    |
        V                    V
    Implements             extends

Ex
.                Car [wheels, speed, engine]       (Interface)
.                               |
.                               |
.                               V
.                           Maruti 800              (Class)
.                         /     |      \
.                        /      |       \
.                       /       |        \
.                  Car1        Car2      Car3
.                  M800        M800       M800

-->     In an interface, All methods are public + abstract by default


-->     Used to achieve total abstraction
        They have no body (without implementation)
        Only method names are visible


-->      Variables in the interface are final, public & static”

.                                              public

.                                              static

.                                              final

        Even if you don’t write them.

        
                Meaning of static : Variable that is created only once”
                                One copy shared by all classes
                                Belongs to interface, not object




                Meaning of final : A variable whose assigned value will remain same”
                                Value cannot be changed
                                It becomes a constant



-->     Interfaces help us to allow "Multiple inheritance"

        Interfaces A    Interfaces B
             \            /
              \          /  
               \        /  
                \      / 
                class C

        class C implements A, B

/*
Golden rule (very important)

Reference type decides which methods you can call
Object type decides which method runs */



Real-world interface examples (important conceptually)


Example 1: Payment system

                interface Payment {
                void pay();
                }

                class UPI implements Payment {
                public void pay() { }
                }

                class CreditCard implements Payment {
                public void pay() { }
                }


Example 2: Device drivers

                interface USB {
                        void connect();
                }

                class Keyboard implements USB { }
                class Mouse implements USB { }
